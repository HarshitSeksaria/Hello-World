*More or less an independant android-dev dwelled in the small villages of the largest state.*

Well, I'm playing with machines since 2012, became a Programmer in 2014 and _`C`_ as my first programming language. I spend a lot of time with _`C`_, even I'd made a messenger with that.

Then I moved to _`Java`_ and _`Python`_. And I learnt a little bit of _`Web Development`_ too.<br> But still my hunger was not satisfied.<br>Further I learnt _`Android Development`_, _`JavaScript`_ and _`Kotlin`_ too.

Then I came to know that _`Android Development`_ is what I was looking for.

I'm a Student right now. But my interest in programming made me a good programmer.<br>
I know _`Android Development`_, _`Web Development`_, _`C`_, _`C++`_, _`Python`_(Including _`Django`_, _`Numpy`_, _`Matplotlib`_), _`Java`_, _`JavaScript`_, _`Kotlin`_, _`HTML`_, _`CSS`_, _`XML`_, _`Firebase`_.<br><br>
My Favorite Language is _`Kotlin`_, **That's Amazing**.


Right now, I use 

 - _`Kotlin`_, _`Java`_ and _`XML`_ for _`Android development`_.
 - _`HTML`_, _`CSS`_ and _`JavaScript`_ for _`Web development`_.
 - _`C++`_ for _`Competitive Programming`_.
 - _`Python`_ for all the basics things.
 
I spend most of the time in _`Android development`_ and in learning new things.
